## Motivation

At first, [_a_wing on X](https://twitter.com/_a_wing/status/1700586549065155043) sharing his image compression workflow, which inspired me to want to package it into a tool. "It will be very convenient to use." I thought.

I have been using many different tools to compress photos for a long time, but I found that it is not very convenient to use. These functions are scattered in different software. I need to open multiple software to modify them to complete my work. 

So I decided to develop a software that integrates these functions.

## Roadmap

You can view the roadmap in [issues with the label `roadmap`](https://github.com/wibus-wee/PhotosProcessor/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc+label:roadmap).
